* About *
Leans into the concept of the Busdriver being a ghost driving a bus full of
ghosts and serves as a prequel to Desert Bus. The bus in Desert Bus is the
equivalent of the ferry, taking souls from "The Meadows" (Las Vegas) to
"The Base of the Black Hills" (Tucson). In this prequel, the Bus Driver
must fight the environment to collect the souls that will fill his bus.

Be Careful Bus Driver

To build Win64, start Visual Studio Code from inside the Visual Studio 2019 x64 Native Build Prompt
To build Emscripten, start Visual Studio Code from within a prompt opened with the emscripten environment

To build both, start an command prompt with both environments setup and then start Visual Studio Code :)
