* Building *

To build Win64, start Visual Studio Code from inside the Visual Studio 2019 x64 Native Build Prompt
To build Emscripten, start Visual Studio Code from within a prompt opened with the emscripten environment

To build both, start an command prompt with both environments setup and then start Visual Studio Code :)
